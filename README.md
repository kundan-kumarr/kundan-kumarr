Hello! I'm a highly skilled PhD student studying Computer Science with a minor in statistics at Iowa State University. My passion lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Self-driving cars, Reinforcement Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, and I'm dedicated to contributing to the open-source software development community in these areas.

Python, Java, and C++ proficiency allows me to create cutting-edge Machine Learning models using libraries such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Scikit Learn, Pandas, and Numpy. My expertise also extends to Software development in Python and Java.

I'm confident in my abilities and eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the exciting world of computer science.
